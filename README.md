# Welcome to the WFEngineering wiki!

## TrackIt:
A cutting-edge tracking system utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be attached to any vehicle in need of monitoring. The system allows users to track the utilization rate of their vehicles, enabling them to make informed decisions about their rental usage and save on costs. By allocating vehicles more efficiently, the system maximizes their potential and ensures that they are meeting the needs of customers. In addition, the system is built on a stable and reliable serverless backend utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies such as Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, S3, and SNS. The user interface is user-friendly and developed on the Android Java platform, providing easy access from any location. This system not only offers cost savings for users, but also helps them make the most of their rental investments.

## Analytics:
The new feature developed for the company's analytical application is designed to convert 5 years of raw data into meaningful insights through feature engineering. This tool allows the company to make more informed decisions about their operations and target their resources more effectively. Service repair orders (SROs) can be compared from year to year using the charts created by this feature, helping the company to ensure that they are meeting or exceeding the standards of previous years. Customers are ranked based on the money they have spent, allowing the company to better target their marketing efforts and focus on the customers that provide the most sales. A sale analysis of different repair job sectors provides valuable visualization to help the company focus their manpower on the areas that will bring in the most revenue. Finally, a productivity rate ranking system has been developed to provide motivation and rewards to those workers who are contributing the most to the company's success. This new feature is expected to greatly benefit the company and help them increase efficiency and profitability.
